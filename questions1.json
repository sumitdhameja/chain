[{"question":"Which of the following would be most likely to result in the creation of net financial value for a firm over the long term?","choices":["A. Reinvest a sizable portion of profits into R\u0026D, upgrades, and automation. ","  B. Get labor cost concessions from employees and distribute these gains to all stakeholders evenly. ","  C. Use increased market leverage to gain price concessions from suppliers. ","  D. Transfer all gains from the company to price discounts to consumers to gain market share. "],"correctAnswer":0,"explain":"While squeezing excess costs out of an enterprise certainly has the potential to provide value to one or more stakeholders, it has to be done carefully. Any manager can reduce costs by reducing staff, cutting outlays for research or training, and delaying expenditures on equipment, but that's generally a recipe for immediate stagnation and eventual failure.  "},{"question":"A design engineer is creating a product that conforms to customer needs according to the supply chain's market intelligence. Which of the following is the most important secondary design element that the engineer should include in the design?","choices":["A. Has a lower price than the competitor's product ","  B. Can reach the market quickly ","  C. Can be sold for a positive return ","  D. Has more features than the competitor's product "],"correctAnswer":2,"explain":"Serving the end-user customer is the primary driver of supply chain decisions. And, second, the organizations in the supply chain have to make a profit and stay in business to serve the customer. Design engineers, or better yet, design teams from across the network design products that are right for the end customer (and can be sold profitably).  "},{"question":"Selection of processes for improvement, according to quality methodology, should be done at which of the following levels?","choices":["A. Middle management ","  B. Teams comprising all levels from top management to regular employees ","  C. Top management ","  D.

Purchase of a component domestically or offshore ","  C. Transfer cost decisions ","  D. Warehouse location decision"],"correctAnswer":1,"explain":"Landed costs include the purchase price of goods plus all other costs involved in getting the goods from the seller to the place where they will be used, such as a manufacturing facility. Landed cost provides a more accurate means of comparing the real costs of goods purchased in different geographic locations for use in the same facility.  "},{"question":"Which of the following is true advice for ensuring that one's supply chain is agile and flexible?","choices":["A. Mixing products to achieve full truckload shipments may be highly inefficient for high-dollar, lightweight items. ","  B. A manufacturer's trends in demand are best monitored through visibility with Tier 1 customers. ","  C. When designing products for maximum supply chain flexibility, putting customers on the design team will help create modular designs. ","  D. Cost efficiencies and velocity must take precedence in the supply chain such as always requiring that full truckloads are used. "],"correctAnswer":0,"explain":"Develop multiple supply chains that are appropriate to each product line. Some companies, to achieve those full truckload shipments, will mix products. While that's a good strategy for speeding up delivery of some products in the mix, it may be highly inefficient for others. Take the high-dollar, lightweight items out of the truck, train, or container and fly them to their destinations.  "},{"question":"As a general rule, instituting JIT in a manufacturing facility affects employees' jobs in which of the following ways?","choices":["A. Jobs are not a focus of change. ","  B. Job responsibilities expand. ","  C. Jobs become more specialized. ","  D. Job tasks are simplified.

"},{"question":"A kaizen event would bring stakeholders together to design which of the following?","choices":["A. A new supply chain ","  B. A new product ","  C. A new corporate organization chart ","  D. A short-term project to improve a process of limited scale "],"correctAnswer":3,"explain":"Kaizen events, also called kaizen blitzes, are used to design small-scale process improvement projects. They are particularly useful at the beginning of large-scale TQM projects to achieve a quick success and thus build credibility for the larger change initiative.  "},{"question":"Developing a JIT supply chain generally implies adopting which of the following strategies with suppliers?","choices":["A. Short-term contracts with revolving suppliers ","  B. Competitive bidding among the widest possible number of suppliers ","  C. Open bidding for flexibility supported by frequent inspection of incoming shipments ","  D. Long-term relationships with a limited number of suppliers "],"correctAnswer":3,"explain":"JIT supply chains generally thrive on long-term contracts with a limited number of suppliers who are willing to adapt JIT principles in their organizations. JIT systems make demands upon suppliers, so contracts need to apportion benefits fairly. Bidding wars among many potential suppliers don't tend to allow for these special relationships. Inspections take up time without adding value, and they are no substitute for trusting relationships with suppliers who have proven their ability to provide quality deliveries without inspection. "},{"question":"Members of a supply chain want to become demand-driven to reduce the bullwhip effect they are experiencing. Which of the following should each partner in the supply chain do?","choices":["A. Adopt new enterprise software systems that match current operating processes as closely as possible. ","  B. Improve their forecasting by basing the information on actual Tier 1 customer orders. ","  C. Reduce their contracted or owned transportation modes to match the new lowered transport needs. ","  D. Develop agility for more frequent changeovers, staffing, or process switching.  "],"correctAnswer":3,"explain":"Demand-driven supply chains require access to real demand data along the chain (visibility), trust and collaboration (including changing processes as needed) among partners, and agility. There will be no room for long changeover times between runs of different products; therefore, equipment, processes, work center layouts, or staffing may have to change.  "},{"question":"In a supply chain context, measurable key performance indicators (KPIs) should be identified for which of the following?","choices":["A. Objectives of all key personnel in related functional areas ","  B. A limited number of top-level corporate and supply chain strategies ","  C. A limited number of essential supply chain processes ","  D. Performance of all products or services from a customer perspective"],"correctAnswer":2,"explain":"Since measuring and monitoring all supply chain activities would be overwhelming, the more useful approach is to identify key performance indicators for a manageable number of supply chain strategic objectives. It is performance of the supply chain that KPIs measure, not employee or product performance.  "},{"question":"Which of the following is true of the Supply-Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model?","choices":["A. SCOR applies to all product transactions (physical material and service). ","  B. SCOR applies to all areas of postdelivery customer support including returns. ","  C. SCOR applies to product development. ","  D. SCOR applies to demand generation in sales and marketing. "],"correctAnswer":0,"explain":"SCOR can be applied to all product transactions, including services as well as material products. SCOR does not apply to any of the incorrect answers. (It does cover returns, but not all of postdelivery customer support.) SCOR is developed and maintained by the Supply-Chain Council.  "},{"question":"Which of the following is true of collaborative relationships in the supply chain?","choices":["A. Companies will always have a good reason to treat competitors in a different class from other types of supply chain members. ","  B. Incompatible hardware or legacy systems are no longer a barrier to collaboration due to new methods of integration. ","  C. The most technologically advanced supply chain partner will determine the level of supply chain development for the network. ","  D. Power-based relationships place long-term gains ahead of short-term results. "],"correctAnswer":0,"explain":"Competitors can often find a way to collaborate with each other for mutual gain, but since each competitor is actively trying to gain market share from the other, the relationships should be kept at arm's length to ensure fairness, and extra caution must be devoted to sharing information. Companies may pretend to embrace collaboration when they really only want access to information for their own benefit. Companies will always have a good reason to treat competitors warily.  "},{"question":"In a TQM initiative, the definition of \"defect\" is determined by which of the following?","choices":["A. Customer ","  B. Top management ","  C. Project team ","  D. Supply chain manager"],"correctAnswer":0,"explain":"According to TQM methodology, defects are defined from the customer's point of view.  "},{"question":"In an electrical generation supply chain, which of the following is a Tier 1 service supplier?","choices":["A. Electric power utility ","  B. Manufacturer connected to electric grid ","  C. Facility maintenance ","  D. Fuel supplier "],"correctAnswer":2,"explain":"The electric power utility is the producer in this supply chain, with fuel suppliers and facility maintenance as Tier 1 suppliers, but only facility maintenance is a service supplier. The manufacturer on the grid is a customer. "},{"question":"A supply chain that produces and sells cigarettes using traditional forecasting at each stage has been experiencing the bullwhip effect. Which of the following has the strongest influence on this effect?","choices":["A. Announced promotions ","  B. Seasonal fluctuations ","  C. Safety stock ","  D. Excess supply liquidation "],"correctAnswer":2,"explain":"Because cigarettes have relatively steady demand, the small variations in demand seen in the forecasting at the retail stage of the supply chain are padded by safety stock. Forecasting at each successive level uses the quantities ordered for forecasting rather than the actual sale amount, resulting in extremely variable demand at the other end of the supply chain. "},{"question":"In a JIT system, reduction in lot sizes may result in which of the following tradeoffs?","choices":["A. Increased cumulative setup time ","  B. Increased inventory accumulation ","  C. Increased holding costs ","  D. Increased handling costs"],"correctAnswer":0,"explain":"JIT reduces lot sizes to bring down inventory accumulation and the costs of holding and handling inventory. However, smaller lot sizes require more frequent orders, and that means more setups. As a consequence, JIT participants need to find ways to reduce setup time.  "},{"question":"According to SCOR Level 1 metrics, which of the following attributes of an organization is measured by the increase in production it can achieve and sustain in 30 days' time?","choices":["A. Sustainability ","  B. Reliability ","  C. Adaptability ","  D. Responsiveness"],"correctAnswer":2,"explain":"An organization's adaptability depends upon the degree to which it can increase and sustain production within 30 days after an unexpected change in the market. "},{"question":"With the theory of supply chain versus supply chain in competition, which of the following is true?","choices":["A. Industries with a small number of dominant suppliers are not ideal but are best coordinated using horizontal supply chains. ","  B. Use of common suppliers in competing chains may work to the advantage of both competitors at a risk of losing proprietary data. ","  C. When supply chains share suppliers, alignment of business strategies with supply chain strategies is facilitated. ","  D. Investments in suppliers shared by a competitor will increase the partnership with that supplier to the detriment of the competitor."],"correctAnswer":1,"explain":"Use of common suppliers in competing chains may work to the advantage of both competitors, but at the very least the situation invites conflict of interest. Insofar as manufacturers want to keep their designs and processes proprietary, they take a risk when they link up with competing component suppliers.  "},{"question":"Which one of the following approaches to production scheduling accurately incorporates the theory of constraints?","choices":["A. Speed up production in front of the bottleneck. ","  B. Decrease inventory at the front of the bottleneck. ","  C. Slow the process down to the bottleneck's speed. ","  D. Speed up production after the bottleneck. "],"correctAnswer":2,"explain":"The theory of constraints focuses attention on slowest-moving part of a manufacturing process because it determines the maximum output of the process. Speeding up production before the constraint only produces an oversupply of inventory in front of the constraint, while speeding up the process after the constraint will result only in a lack of inventory after the constraint. Avoiding either of these problems requires running the process at the speed of the constraint. "},{"question":"The Japanese term \"kaizen\" refers to which of the following business processes?","choices":["A. Display cards used as production signals ","  B. Root cause ","  C. Interlocking business ownership ","  D. Continuous process improvement"],"correctAnswer":3,"explain":"\"Kaizen\" is the Japanese term for continuous improvement.

It is calculated as available production divided by rate of customer demand.  "},{"question":"According to total quality theory, which of the following would be of primary importance to document during the analysis phase of a continuous improvement initiative?","choices":["A. Customer attitudes toward the product produced by the process ","  B. Staff-level views of the practical difficulties involved in carrying out the process ","  C. Executive-level positions on the importance of the process ","  D. A thorough, factual description of the process "],"correctAnswer":3,"explain":"Quality theory emphasizes the importance of data; therefore, improvement initiatives begin with a complete, unbiased, factual description of the process.  "},{"question":"Which of the following cost-cutting measures will be most likely to create net financial value?","choices":["A. Eliminating retail locations and selling direct to customers ","  B. Eliminating partial truckload shipments and sending only full truckload shipments to retail outlets to save on shipping ","  C. Eliminating local storage facilities to save on warehousing costs ","  D. Eliminating inventory holding costs by having suppliers carry more inventory and ship on demand"],"correctAnswer":0,"explain":"Only the correct answer removes an element of the supply chain without lowering the net value for the customer. Cost cutting must aim for net gains at the bottom line, and the incorrect answers all create new costs for other areas of the company or supply chain. If a leaner supply chain can deliver the same customer satisfaction with a greater profit, then cost cutting is fully justified. "},{"question":"Slip sheets can be used in place of which of the following?","choices":["A. Conveyers ","  B. Shipping containers ","  C. Pallets ","  D.

"},{"question":"Which of the following is true of the processes or information technology (IT) that comprises supply chain management strategy?","choices":["A. A virtual network describes a network composed solely of IT linkages that a single entity runs. ","  B. Orders in the delivery chain should be pulled through by manufacturer capacity. ","  C. Having two supply chains helps when order timing and fulfillment is crucial in one supply chain but secondary in another. ","  D. The most significant barrier to the use of IT for collaboration and networking among firms is the cost of the IT. "],"correctAnswer":2,"explain":"Order fulfillment is the delivery of the right product in the amounts at the right time and place and in the right condition. All of these \"rights\" should be determined in alignment with the supply chain strategy. Different types of order fulfillment processes are needed for different markets, which justifies having more than a single supply chain.  "},{"question":"If a firm locates a centralized procurement and processing facility in a low-tax foreign country, which of the following tax rates will apply to income generated at the facility?","choices":["A. The rate in the country of the headquarters ","  B. A compromise rate between the local and home country rates ","  C. The local country rate ","  D.

Direct/core competency materials ","  B. Commodity materials ","  C. Bottleneck materials ","  D. Leveragable materials "],"correctAnswer":3,"explain":"Leveragable materials are of high strategic importance but of low supply chain difficulty, so they are key areas where supply chain leverage can be applied to increase efficiencies and lower costs.  "},{"question":"Which of the following is the best way for top management to show commitment in cross-enterprise collaboration activities?","choices":["A. Focus on future strategy and delegate the task of maintaining the current focus on supply chain interactions. ","  B. Enforce collaborative agreements within their internal staff and discipline counterproductive actions. ","  C. Give frequent motivational speeches to internal and external managers. ","  D. Set the collaboration agreement and strictly enforce it without allowing the plan to be changed due to circumstances brought up by lower managers. "],"correctAnswer":1,"explain":"Top management commitment is demonstrated by actions and relationship building, not just words. Top management is responsible for keeping the focus on supply chain interactions and cannot abdicate this duty. If they do not provide proactive and enthusiastic support, their company will quickly fall back to its old ways of doing things. "},{"question":"According to the Supply-Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model, if a refrigerator manufacturing company is at the center of the model, the supplier of materials to the sheet metal supplier has only which of the following processes to perform in relation to the manufacturer?","choices":["A.

"},{"question":"Which of the following is likely when a retailer of children's toys uses traditional forecasting to anticipate demand (as does their wholesaler) and adds some safety stock to orders both to smooth out the inevitable variations from the forecast and to replenish supplies after a promotion (not communicated to their suppliers) that the retailer plans to have to liquidate excess inventory?","choices":["A. High inventory holding costs for the retailer and high variability of demand for the wholesaler ","  B. Low inventory holding costs for the retailer and low variability of demand for the wholesaler ","  C. Low inventory holding costs for the retailer and high variability of demand for the wholesaler ","  D. High inventory holding costs for the retailer and low variability of demand for the wholesaler "],"correctAnswer":0,"explain":"The retailer will have high inventory holding costs even though they are having a promotion to liquidate excess inventory because they are perpetuating a cycle of overordering inventory due to uncertain demand forecasts. The wholesaler will have high variability of demand because traditional forecasting and lack of communication about promotions will cause each stage of the supply chain to compensate with greater safety stock. In short, the situation describes the bullwhip effect. "},{"question":"Which of the following usually implicitly exists in very simple supply chains such as a lemonade stand but must be explicitly managed in a complex supply chain of massive scale?","choices":["A. Supplier management ","  B. Collection and accounting for sales taxes ","  C. Collaboration between manufacturer and retailer ","  D. Compliance with government regulations"],"correctAnswer":2,"explain":"A lemonade stand may not include any of the items in the incorrect answers, but it will generally have a good deal of collaborative planning in regard to demand forecasts and replenishment between the manufacturer and retailers (mother and children). Some of the problems that supply chain management strives to overcome are implicit in a simple model but must be explicitly managed in a complex supply chain because they arise as a direct result of the massive scale of modern supply chains.
