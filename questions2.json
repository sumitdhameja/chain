Personal experience ","  B. Bandwagon effect ","  C. Intuition ","  D. Collective view of their markets"],"correctAnswer":1,"explain":"The \"bandwagon effect\" (also called \"groupthink\") can distort the conclusions of a panel if a strong leader emerges with a convincing but wrong-headed view, or if all participants reinforce one another in reaching an exaggerated conclusion. An entire sales force acting in concert may, however, benefit from experience, collective knowledge of the broad market served by the organization, and even intuition.

Combined plane and truck transport ","  D. Any intermodal method of transport "],"correctAnswer":0,"explain":"In piggyback service either a truck trailer or a container travels part of the way over the road and part of the way on a railroad flatcar.

Design for logistics ","  C. Over-the-wall design ","  D. Design for reverse logistics"],"correctAnswer":3,"explain":"Design for reverse logistics looks for ways to make products that can be easily reused, returned, or recycled. (Whether the beer bottles can be reused or not has no effect upon logistics in the forward chain, only in the reverse chain that brings the product back at the end of its life cycle.) "},{"question":"Which of the following would be subject to alteration as the result of decisions made in an executive S\u0026OP meeting?","choices":["A. Product features ","  B. Product pricing ","  C. Weekly production schedules ","  D. Business plan"],"correctAnswer":3,"explain":"The monthly S\u0026OP meeting deals with aggregate-level information about product families and output.

"},{"question":"The forecasting method known as the pyramid technique specifically incorporates which one of the following principles of forecasting?","choices":["A. Forecasts are always wrong. ","  B. Short-range forecasts are more reliable than long-range forecasts. ","  C. Product group forecasts are more reliable than single-product forecasts. ","  D. Quantitative data are preferable to qualitative estimates. "],"correctAnswer":2,"explain":"Product group forecasts are more reliable than single-product forecasts, so the pyramid technique begins by forecasting demand for the product family and then disaggregates the demand to generate single-product demand forecasts. This ensures alignment between forecasts for the group and the components of the group. (This is not to imply that the technique ignores other principles, only that it specifically relies upon the superior reliability of group forecasting.)  "},{"question":"Which of the following pieces of warehouse equipment provides maximum flexibility in the movement, placement, and retrieval of pallets?","choices":["A. Forklift truck ","  B.

This is an approximate application of the Pareto principle, or 80-20 rule, which holds that about 20 percent of possible causes account for about 80 percent of outcomes.  "},{"question":"Which of the following provides a point of reference for formulating the sales and operations plan?","choices":["A. Production forecast ","  B. Financial plan ","  C. Marketing plan ","  D.

DDP ","  B. FOB ","  C. CIP ","  D. EXW"],"correctAnswer":0,"explain":"While it's not necessary to memorize the meanings of Incoterms, the important point to recall is that they exist to clarify the responsibilities of exporter and importer in a carriage contract. Of the four groups of terms, the E group (comprising only the single term EXW) puts the most responsibility on the importer, while the D group assigns almost all responsibility to the exporter. DDP, for example, means \"Delivered Duty Paid\" (that is, paid by the exporter).  "},{"question":"If you were able to get a 20 percent discount on any of the following logistics expenses, which would you choose to receive the maximum cost savings?","choices":["A. Transportation ","  B. Materials handling ","  C. Compliance ","  D. Warehousing "],"correctAnswer":0,"explain":"Transportation expenses make up the largest portion of the logistics budget, so taking the discount on transportation costs would give you the largest cost reduction. (Of course, you would have to consider possible tradeoffs if discounting transportation caused cost increases elsewhere in the system.) "},{"question":"For which of the following items should demand be calculated rather than forecast?","choices":["A. All Chevrolets ","  B. All Chevrolet Cobalts ","  C. All steering wheels for new Chevrolet Cobalts ","  D.

Recipients ","  C. Carriers ","  D. Shippers"],"correctAnswer":0,"explain":"All market participants can benefit from well-crafted regulations regarding such matters as fairness and safety, but the public at large is most likely to be in synch with the government on the broad spectrum of regulations, from pricing through access to safety and environmental stewardship.

Total costs drop up to a point and then rise steadily. ","  B. Setup and order costs remain constant while holding costs drop steadily. ","  C. Economies of scale lower all holding and ordering/setup costs equally and steadily. ","  D. Holding costs remain constant while setup costs rise steadily. "],"correctAnswer":0,"explain":"The larger the order, the higher the holding costs, because there is more inventory to hold. Setup costs tend to go down as orders grow larger because of economies of scale. (Larger orders can be placed less frequently than smaller orders, thus reducing the number of setups.) "},{"question":"Which one of the following is the most compelling reason for a manufacturer to own its own warehouses rather than using a contractor's warehouses?","choices":["A.

Inventory increases and the ratio of storage space to total square feet increases. ","  D. Inventory decreases and the ratio of storage space to total square feet decreases"],"correctAnswer":0,"explain":"Increasing the number of warehouses tends to cause an increase in inventory as each adds a buffer of supply stock. On the other hand, the ratio of storage space to total square feet tends to decrease as each facility contains nonstorage areas that could be consolidated in a single warehouse. "},{"question":"The marketing department's involvement with product management includes which of the following phases of the product's life cycle?","choices":["A.

Less rapid adjustment to new customer technologies ","  B. Reduction in flexible deployment of resources ","  C. Reduction in control ","  D. Reduced economies of scale "],"correctAnswer":2,"explain":"Transferring responsibility for logistics to a 4PL involves loss of control, so a manager may want to compensate with frequent reviews (at least at first). The upside of giving control of logistics to a specialist should be an increase in flexibility, greater economies of scale, and more advanced logistics technology.

Increased inventory holding costs"],"correctAnswer":0,"explain":"Removing an echelon from the network should reduce all the costs specified in the options except for transportation costs. Removing one level of warehousing, for example, will most likely increase the number of miles goods are carried from the points upstream from the echelon to the points downstream.  "},{"question":"In the CPFR model, which of the following corresponds to the order-to-cash cycle?","choices":["A. Demand and supply management ","  B. Logistics/distribution ","  C. Execution ","  D.

With a larger store of goods in the central warehouse, even the largest, unexpected order will have less chance of exhausting the inventory, as it might in a smaller warehouse. With fewer facilities adding safety stock to their orders (plus the lower stockout risk), the total amount of inventory can be reduced, and less inventory means lower holding and handling expenses. Lead times may go up, however, for deliveries made to customers that are more distant from the central warehouse than from the smaller facilities it replaced.
